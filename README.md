Particle Playground
===================

This is a sandbox for simulating two-dimensional particle physics. It is not
intended to be physically accurate to any standard, instead it is best used for
interactive entertainment.

View the [live example](https://mdciotti.github.io/particle-playground/).

## Build Instructions

All source files are written in [ES6](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) and
[Less](http://lesscss.org/), then bundled with
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

Clone the repository and run `npm install` in the project directory to install
development dependencies.

Use the command `npm run bundle` or `npm run watch` to build all changes or
watch and rebuild as changes are made, respectively.

Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome is recommended). No development server is
necessary, but there is certainly no harm in using one.
