Particle Playground
===================

This is a sandbox for simulating two-dimensional particle physics. It is not
intended to be physically accurate to any standard, instead it is best used for
interactive entertainment.

## To-do

* [ ] Add bin menu
* [ ] Add physics and appearance settings presets
* [ ] Add simulation presets
* [x] Fix selections
* [ ] Improve Gui binding
* [ ] Simulation pause/play/speed
* [ ] Multiple integrators
* [x] Pan, zoom, grab(?) tools
* [ ] Color controller UI
* [ ] Vector controller UI
* [ ] Preserve selection/following on merge
* [ ] Inelastic collisions (sticky)
* [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
* [ ] Store user settings in LocalStorage
* [ ] Look into using Web Workers for collider
* [ ] Look into using Polymer
* [ ] Use Object.observe() for Controller value watching
* [x] Selection polygons

## Build Instructions

All source files are written in [ES6](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)
(transpiled with Babel) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/), then bundled with
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

Clone the repository and run `npm install` in the project directory to install
development dependencies.

Use the command `npm run bundle` or `npm run watch` to build all changes or
watch and rebuild as changes are made, respectively.

Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome is recommended). No development server is
necessary, but there is certainly no harm in using one.
